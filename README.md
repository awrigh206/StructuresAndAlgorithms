# StructuresAndAlgorithms

A few basic algorithms and data structures implemented in java.

Included Algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Heap sort

Included Data Structures: Linked List, Heap and Binary Search Tree.

All alogirthms are generic and work with all objects. (you will need to override the hashcode function on objects for the sort functions to operate).

## To-Do

1) Fix the heap so that it actually works
2) Implement the A* algorithm
3) Research and complete red/black tree data strcuture

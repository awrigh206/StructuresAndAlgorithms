# StructuresAndAlgorithms

A few basic algorithms and data structures implemented in java.

Included Algorithms: Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Heap sort

Included Data Structures: Linked List, Heap and Binary Search Tree

#To-Do

1) Fix the heap so that it actually works
2) Implement the A* algorithm
3) Research and complete red/black tree data strcuture
